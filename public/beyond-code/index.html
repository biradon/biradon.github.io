I was the Vice President of the Saigon Dragonflies Quadball Community. At the time, quadball in Saigon was small and lacked internal connection.
My mission was to strengthen internal bonds and expand the community. I hosted training programs, analyzed match videos to develop new strategies for my team, and made a remarkable contribution by creating a radio series for the national quadball community.
As a result, our community grew from 42 to 134 members, and my radio series received widespread praise. People eagerly awaited each episode, and some even organized offline hangouts to listen to the broadcasts together.">
