### Hi, I'm Minh 🙋‍♂️

I love sharing new ideas, dreams, and software 👨‍💻

I’m a **Computer Programming** student at George Brown College! Outside of school, I’m a semi-professional quidditch player, an enthusiastic presenter, and a former filmmaker. I enjoy public speaking, playing guitar, reading manga, and spending time with my family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

I created this website as a non-verbal way to communicate with the world—a place to capture and share my thoughts and experiences. By converting my ideas into writing, I aim to grow as a technologist and writer 📝

I’m incredibly fortunate to have loving family and friends. In a nutshell, I’m having a life worth living 🍀
