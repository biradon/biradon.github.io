Hi, I'm Minh, and I like to share new things, dreams, and software 👨‍💻

I’m a **Computer Programming Student** at George Brown College! Outside of school stuff. I’m a semi-professional quidditch player, enthusiastic presenter, and former filmmaker. I enjoy public speaking, playing guitar, hanging out with my family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

### Leadership in Action 🤾‍♂️

I was the Vice President of the **Saigon Dragonflies Quadball Community**. At the time, quadball in Saigon was small and lacked internal connection. 

My mission was to strengthen internal bonds and expand the community. I hosted training programs, analyzed match videos to develop new strategies for my team, and made a remarkable contribution by creating a radio series for the national quadball community.


As a result, our community grew from **42 to 134 members**, and my radio series received widespread praise. People eagerly awaited each episode, and some even organized offline hangouts to listen to the broadcasts together.

### Craving Public Speaking 🎙
When I was a child, I can't even count how many **TED Talks** I watched. At that time, I didn’t fully understand what the speakers were talking about, but the impression they left was unforgettable. All I could see was how cool and confident they seemed. From that moment, I decided that one day I would become a presenter—a public speaker.


To pursue this dream, I participated in as many presentation and speech contests as I could during my school and college years. Below are the results of my journey so far:

- Japanese Speaker Forum - 1st Prize 🏆
- Music Video Competition - Our School - 1st Prize 🏆
- Hosei Speech Contest 2017 - 1st Prize 🏆
- Kakei Speech Contest 2018 - Top 10 🏅
- South University Speech Contest 2019 - 3rd Prize 🥉

## Looking Ahead 🌞
Hopefully, you enjoy my story so far. I’d love for you to be part of this journey—let’s connect and create the next chapter together
