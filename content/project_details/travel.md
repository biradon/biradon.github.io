### Overview 📜
This is one of my assignments in the **Web Application Development** course at George Brown College. I collaborated with two other classmates to create the entire Travel E-Commerce web application and publish it.

### What I did 👨‍💻
For this project, I decided to focus mainly on the **Front-End**, an area I wasn't particularly strong in. I wanted to challenge myself by stepping into a different role and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. At the same time, I also took care of the **deployment step** using Azure.

### What I got 💪
This was my first time building an entire web application, from Front-End to Back-End, and deploying it using the **MVC structure**. It was great to see how all the parts connected together, and I gained a lot of knowledge in web application development through this project.

I have to give a shout-out to **Professor Sergio Santilli**. While many students may not have appreciated his teaching style, I personally admired his dedication and his ability to push students beyond their knowledge and comfort zones. All of his challenging assignments got me excited to create more on my own.
