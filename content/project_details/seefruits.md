### Overview 📜
This is the **[hackathon](https://hackcanada.org/) project** I joined with my team in Waterloo. It was my first hackathon ever, and we were all so inspired by the vibe from Silicon Valley. The whole 2 days felt like a mini Silicon Valley experience!

(That's why our app's name is SeeFruits 😆)

### What I did 👨‍💻
I was the **UI/UX Designer** and worked on prompt engineering to design the LLM that fit our needs. I integrated it with Gemini Flask 2.0 and created a FastAPI server to connect with our front-end.

I also did research on **ugly fruit** to prepare for our presentation, where we presented alongside big tech companies like Google, Near, and venture capitalists (VCs)—my first time being critiqued by VCs 🤪

At the same time, I acted as a **scrum master**, helping my teammates overcome obstacles such as a lack of coffee, guiding them to locations, and coordinating with organizers.

### What I got 💪
It was my first-ever experience in a hackathon, and I had a dozen moments of fun with my team. Besides all the valuable insights shared by the mentors, organizers, and judges, I think the thing I value the most are the memories I created with my friends. This is one of the moments I truly enjoyed being a student 👨‍🎓
