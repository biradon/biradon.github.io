### Background story 📜
I'm working as a Welcome Desk Ambassador in Casa Loma campus at George Brown College. By the chance I'm working here, I have an opportunity to listen to the conservation from students about where the locker they want to rent is located. Based on that, I popped up to create **a website for students to know where the locker they want to rent** and apply what I learned. 

### What I did 👨‍💻
I'm using the automation script from Python to scrape the data from StuView (student's portal) and used Flask as a Backend for the website. For the students could get the new data, they can click the button to fetch the latest data. I went around the campus to check locker ID and to draw a map for my website using Figma. And last but not least, I released my website by using EC2 and Docker.

### What I got 📚
The first day to show for the student who came and asked me how to rent the locker and I was confident to show my website to them and received several decent feedback. During that time, I recognized the pretty interesting thing that the rental locker system would display available lockers depending on which program the student was in (Initially, I thought that every student would view the same available lockers). By doing this project, I reviewed all of the knowledge and learned many new skills for my future career path.
