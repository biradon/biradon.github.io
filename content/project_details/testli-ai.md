### Overview 📜

After completing it, they will receive answers along with suggestions on which areas they need to study to improve their score.

### Where we're so far 💪
The project is currently in development, and we will soon be launching it commercially. I'm so excited because I have many friends who teach English at high schools and middle schools, and they really need this project to come to life.
Right now, we're developing the backend and fine-tuning the [model](https://huggingface.co/testli) to make it more flexible and adaptable to any requirements I may have 😋
